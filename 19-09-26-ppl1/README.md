# Probabilistic Programming Languages

Things we have talked about:

 1. Probabilistic Models vs Non-probabilistic Models
    * Prior, likelihood, posterior distribution
    * Maximum likelihood vs Posterior distribution
    * Deep Learning vs Probabilistic Programming
 2. Monte-Carlo methods
    * Metropolis-Hastings
 3. Building your own probabilistic programming language
    * `Sample` and `Observe` primitives
    * Collecting traces
    * Optimization ~ Inference
