# Pytorch Introduction

Video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEdC8y5V1T0).

Things we have talked about:

 1. Automatic differentiation
    * Backward mode
    * Forward mode
    * How to implement both in a few lines of code
 2. Gradient descent
    * SGD vs Rprop, Adam
    * Learning rate
    * Optimizing simple functions
 3. Solving MNIST using a very simple neural network
    * Batching
    * Sparsity encouraging loss
 4. Practical use of Pytorch - [Fuzzball](https://github.com/alexknvl/fuzzball)
    * RNNs (LSTM, GRU)
    * Model serialization (`nn.Module`)
